Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem Solution Modelization
=========================================================

This section is about the packages solution of the project. This package is
the modelization of the solution of a Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem in python.


The package
-----------

The package is composed of multiple modules:
- Modules for modelizing the CVRP's solution
- Modules to find a feasible solution using different techniques

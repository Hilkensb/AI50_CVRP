Introduction
============

Context
-------

The project CVRP aims to modelize and simulate the traject that people need to do with different kinds of transportations. For that, we will implement and compare different types of algorithms that will optimise certain values of their target, like time or distance. 

To test the algorithms we will use public benchmarks which will contain enough datas to reduce the variance of results. Those benchmarks can represent rail networks, bus companies, factors or even taxis.

The use of different algorithms will allow us to have the best optimization for each type of situation and value to optimize. In fact some algorithms may be better in optimizing a large amount of data, or others may be efficient in general without being the top in each type. Finally we will also need to take account of the time each algorithme takes to optimize.

For our project we will focus on a delivery system in which we will optimize the distance and traject time that the delivery man can do in a set period of time

To test and compare the solutions provides by this program, the instance file on cvrplib_ will be use. Please note that the input should be format has the instance file found on this website.
